# NYCDOE-High-School-Data
This is a project repository containing SQL code specifically pulling data from three NYCDOE datasets looking at NYC High Schools - their demographics of the student population, graduation rates, and breaking down those trends by borough. 

What inspired this project? I was thinking about an SQL project I could use NYCDOE datasets to analyze large trends across the largest education system in the United States with 1.1 million students. I wanted to focus on specifically high schools within New York City as this is an interesting area where many policies are developed to help prepare students for college readiness, college success, and career exploration. In fact, many nonprofits within New York City exist serving the high school student population within with the same areas listed above, as students often lack the resources necessary to improve their understanding of college or career choices post-graduation. In this analysis, I seek out to gain a holistic understanding to see where do the high school student population within New York City stand when it comes to these critical areas. 

For the datasets - I used information from three different datasets provided by the DOE InfoHUB and NYC Open Data.

1. 2021 NYC High School Directory - I used the 2021 NYC High School Directory to find out how many high schools exist within the NYCDOE educational system and to gain a broader understanding of how those schools perform in terms of college readiness, attendance, academic success, and many other factors. This dataset offers a descriptive understanding of what the high school has to offer for prospective high school students and their families.

2. NYCDOE Demographic Snapshot - I used the NYCDOE Demographic Snapshot to provide the demographic information for all high schools within the NYCDOE educational system. This dataset contains information describing the race/ethnicity and gender characteristics of the student population, total enrollment per grade level and the school itself, along with the amount of students in the poverty and are economically disadvantaged.
